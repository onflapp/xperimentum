KNOWN BUGS:
~~~~~~~~~~
- [bug #25571] exception on removing author in project inspector.
  This happens to me with project-center-0.5.0.
  in the Project Inspector -> Project Description, click the Add button to 
  add an Author now the text input field is active, to add an author, as 
  long as this is active, and then pressing remove button, to remove an 
  author, then PC exits with the following exception:

  NSRangeException: Index 1 is out of range 1 (in 'removeObjectAtIndex:')

- [sr #106614] ProjectCenter, document type extensions.
  In the project center project properties editor, if there are several
  extensions separated bya space, they should be encoded as element arrays

- [bug #25193] pc fails to load project from ImageViewer.pc.project.

- [bug #22815] ProjectCenter won't open a new project .
  [doesn't work for me]

- [bug #22411] font types in ProjectCenter Editor.

- [bug #22441] Usability: Project Center should have a separate project type 
  for Renaissance based applications

- [bug #22124] ProjectCenter doesn't support extra entries in Plist.

- [bug #22008] Project Center should support more flexible directory 
  configurations.

- [bug #22026] ProjectCenter should split up project file.

- [bug #11931] Build before launch on change.

- [bug #20858] UI components (editor, builder, launcher).
  The latest change fixes the initial problem but introduces a new one!

  The new issue is that doesn't matter what I check or uncheck on the Interface
  Preferences the only thing that is shown is the Editor in the SplitView.
  It's reproducable every time, no matter what.  All you need to do is check
  every option, so that only the browser will be shown, then uncheck random
  options.

  On another note, but still related, when the Editor is shown (after being
  hidden by the preferences) it doesn't preserve it's previous size.

RELEASE CRTITICAL UNKNOWN BUGS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ProjectBuilder's incorrectly parses output of gnustep-make (incorrect 
  directories, incorrectly recognises initial point of error etc.).
- Browser must be double checked for correct behaviour on browsing,
  file removal, opening editor (currently is bad).
- It seems that changing subproject's attributes doesn't change 'edited'
  state of project window.
- Removing files works bad (crashes, strange warnings, exceptions). Check it!
  Maybe this happens only in subprojects... It may be connected to browser's
  functionality.
- PC tries to load internal editor for .gorm files. Fix it!!!
- Setting localizable resources through inspector works bad. Double check it
  and fix!!! Also check this functionality when multiple files selected.
- Double check support for "Resource Set" project type as subproject of
  existing projecttypes.
- 

WHISH LIST:
~~~~~~~~~~
+ Open panel with list of modified files on project close and project build.
- Think about browser initial responder status: now very uncomfortable 
  to find some file in browser list when editor is open.
- "Project Attributes" for Application should be reviewed after split of
  "Application" to "Application" and "Renaissance" project types.
- Add setting to preferences "Create template-based files on project creation". 
  It should allow to switch off creation of .m, .h, .gorm files from templates.
