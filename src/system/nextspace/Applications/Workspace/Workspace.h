   WMInspector

   Inherits From: Object
   
   Declared In:	  apps/Workspace.h

   Class Description

   The WMInspector class defines the link between the Workspace Manager
   application and the module that's loaded into the application.  When
   you build a new inspector for the Workspace Manager, you must create a
   subclass of WMInspector.  The inspector you define must load its
   interface (that is, the nib file containing the interface) in its new
   method.  It must also override the inherited revert: method to load
   information about the selection into its display.

   Your inspector can query the Workspace Manager for information on the
   selection in the File Viewer by sending itself selectionCount and
   selectionPathInto:separator: messages.  It can send itself okButton,
   revertButton, and window messages to gain access to those features of the
   Inspector panel.

   Although the Contents inspector's principal role is to let the user view
   the contents of a File Viewer entry, it can also let the user edit the
   displayed data.  It's best not to overuse this capability, however, since
   the Contents inspector wasn't designed to substitute for normal
   applications.

   An inspector that permits editing should send itself a touch: message when
   the user begins modifying the data.  This message enables the inspector's
   OK and Revert buttons and displays a broken "X" in the panel's close box.
   (See textDidChange: for an alternate way to achieve this result.)  The
   inspector should implement the ok: method to commit the modifications the
   user has made.

// Class Methods

/** Creates a new WMInspector if none exists, or returns the existing one.
    When the object is created, it must load the nib file that contains the
    inspector's display.

    The Workspace Manager sends a new message whenever it needs to access the
    inspector object. Thus, your subclass of WMInspector should ensure that
    no more than one instance of its class is created.*/

// Instance Methods

/** Implement in your subclass to commit the changes that the user has made to
    the selected item.  The OK button in the Inspector panel sends an ok:
    message when the user clicks it.
    This method is optional, but if you implement it, you must send the same
    message to super as part of your implementation*/
- ok:sender;

/** Returns the id of the Inspector's OK button.  This can be useful if you
    want to alter its title, for example. */

/** Implement in your subclass to load data into the inspector's display.  The
    Workspace Manager sends this message to the inspector object whenever the
    inspector's display might need to be updated; for example, when the
    Inspector panel is opened or when the selection changes in the File
    Viewer.*/

/** Returns the id of the Inspector's Revert button.  This can be useful if you
    want to alter its title, for example.*/

/** Returns the number of items selected in the File Viewer. You can use this
    information to determine whether your inspector should be displayed.  For
    example, most inspectors can give information on only one file at a time,
    so within their revert: methods, they would have this test:

    if ([self selectionCount] != 1)
      {
        return nil;
      }
    else
      {
        // get the path and display the file's contents
      }

/** Returns the paths of the files selected in the File Viewer. The paths are
    place in the string pathString; each path is separated from the previous
    one by character.  For example, if character is `:', pathString could
    contain "/me/test1:/me/test2:/me/test3".

    If your inspector acts on only one file at a time (see selectionCount),
    the file's path can be identified using this message:

    char fullPath[MAXPATHLEN+1];
    [self selectionPathsInto:fullPath separator:'\0'];

/** Sends the WMInspector a touch: message on behalf of some Text object in
    the Inspector panel.

    By making your inspector object the delegate of any Text object in your
    inspector's display, the Inspector panel will be updated appropriately as
    the user alters the panel's contents.*/
